# IoT Based Patient Monitoring

This paper presents an affordable medical sensor system implemented on the Arduino platform. It simultaneously measures blood saturation levels (SpO2), heart rate, and body temperature. The system employs spectrophotometry for pulse oximetry, calculating oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin ratios for SpO2 calculation. 

Improved accuracy is achieved using LED driver circuits and variable baseline adjustments for different skin tones. The system displays results on an LCD, transmits data via Bluetooth to Android devices, and via Wi-Fi to the internet, establishing an IoT platform. This low-cost wearable system can monitor vital health parameters for patients in hospitals or at home, serving as a plug-and-play solution using Arduino.
